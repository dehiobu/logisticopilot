    Renders a delay summary using the Jinja2 template and provided shipment data.

    Args:
        shipments (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
            single delayed shipment. Each dictionary is expected to have the following keys:
            - shipment_id (str): Unique identifier for the shipment.
            - status (str): Current status of the shipment (e.g., "Delayed", "In Transit").
            - eta (str): Estimated time of arrival or delay information.
            - action (str): Recommended action to take for this specific shipment.

    Returns:
        str: The rendered alert message, formatted as a natural language block,
            ready for display or further processing by LogiBot.
